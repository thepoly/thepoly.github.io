The fall semester election shall be known as the Fall election. The spring semester election shall be known as the Spring election.</p></li><li><p>Notification of the elections will be made by an announcement appearing on the website of <em>The Polytechnic</em> two weeks immediately prior to the election.</p></li><li><p>Election Procedures</p><ol><li><p>Only current members of the voting constituency on the day of elections are eligible to vote. The voting constituency shall consist of staff who are members of the Rensselaer Union, have contributed to <em>The Polytechnic</em> for six weeks, have attended at least two consecutive business meetings, and have informed the editor in chief of their intention to join the voting staff. Membership in the voting constituency is maintained as long as an individual is a member of the Rensselaer Union, does not wish to resign, is not removed, and–should the member not hold a named position on <em>The Polytechnic</em>’s staff–informs the editor in chief of their desire to vote no less than one week before an election.</p></li><li><p>Members of the voting constituency may nominate anyone, including themselves, for any elected position. Nominations for each position will be accepted until the time when the election for that position is begun.</p></li><li><p>Elections for each position shall be one at a time, in the order of: editor in chief, senior managing editor, managing editor(s), contributing editor(s), news editor, business manager, features editor, sports editor, editorial_opinion editor, composing editor, copy editor, photography editor, associate news editor(s), associate features editor(s), associate sports editor(s), associate editorial_opinion editor(s), associate composing editor(s), associate copy editor(s), and associate photography editor(s). An election for the position of editor in chief or senior managing editor shall not be held during the Spring election unless the position is vacant.</p></li><li><p>When the turn comes for a certain position’s election to be held, all candidates shall be given equal time to speak on their own behalf, if they so choose. Then all candidates running for the position in question shall leave the room, and discussion shall be held amongst those present, with the editor in chief or highest ranking editor as defined below in section (VI), subsection (B), part (1) if the editor in chief is ineligible, presiding. Voting will then proceed as follows:</p><ol><li><p>If the number of people nominated is greater than the total number of openings plus one, then a series of primary votes shall be held, with the person garnering the least number of votes eliminated after each balloting until only the total number of vacancies remain plus one.</p></li><li><p>Once primaries, if necessary, are completed, each voting member will then vote for one person in the elections of editor in chief, senior managing editor, and all department editors; up to two people in the elections of managing editors, contributing editors, and all associate editors; or cast a no vote against all persons running. To win, a candidate must receive votes from a majority of a voting constituency quorum.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>All elections shall be held by secret ballot. This may be waived by the unanimous vote of the voting constituency quorum.</p></li><li><p>Ballots for each election, both during primaries and final balloting, shall be counted by the editor in chief, or the next highest person in the order of succession as defined below in section (VI), subsection (B), part (1) if the editor in chief is ineligible due to a conflict of interest. Whoever is counting the ballots shall not vote in that election, but shall cast the deciding vote if a candidate receives exactly half of the votes of the voting constituency quorum.</p></li><li><p>Quorum for elections is defined as two-thirds of the total voting constituency.</p></li><li><p>Absentee ballots shall be allowed. They must be submitted to the editor in chief in a sealed envelope no more than five days before the election. The person casting the ballots shall not count towards quorum during elections.</p></li><li><p>Abstentions may be used for any reason. A voter must recuse themselves in the event of a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Recusations do not count towards quorum and those recusing themselves may not participate in discussions.</p></li><li><p>All winning candidates take office immediately upon completion of the election of their position, and the term of office of their predecessor, if there is one, ends at that time.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p>For all meetings, positions not filled shall not count towards quorum.</p></li></ol><h2 id=section-vi-terms-of-office-vacancies-order-of-succession-and-removal>Section VI: Terms of Office, Vacancies, Order of Succession, and Removal</h2><ol><li><p>Terms of Office and Term Limits</p><ol><li><p>The term of office for the positions of editor in chief and senior managing editor shall be one two-semester election cycle, commencing at the time of election and ending with the election held the following Fall election.

If, due to any circumstance, there is no other person left in the order of succession, the voting constituency of <em>The Polytechnic</em> shall be called into a general meeting by the President of the Union for the purposes of electing an editor in chief. The election of other editors shall then proceed as stated in section (V), subsection (D).

Any member of the voting constituency who fails to meet his or her obligations and responsibilities to <em>The Polytechnic</em> can have their voting rights immediately revoked by a two-thirds vote of the voting constituency quorum at a meeting called for that purpose or at any election.</p></li><li><p>Meetings to remove shall be called by a majority vote of the editorial board. The editor in chief, or other highest-ranking staff member (if the editor in chief is the impeached individual), has the obligation to inform the impeached individual of that meeting’s time and place at least seven days in advance of said meeting. The impeached individual has the right to attend that meeting and speak on their own behalf.</p></li><li><p>The grounds for removal from the editorial board or revocation of voting rights include, but are not limited to: two unexcused absences from business meetings in one semester (excuses for absence may be granted only by the editor in chief), consistent failure to perform the duties of the position to which they were elected, violation of editorial confidence, failure to practice the ethics of responsible journalism, or violation of Institute, Rensselaer Union, or club policies.</p></li><li><p>The grounds resulting in the removal from office or the revocation of voting rights may be referred to the Rensselaer Union Judicial Board as an appeal case.
