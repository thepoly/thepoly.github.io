Some others are acceptable depending on the context. But in general, do not use abbreviations or acronyms that the reader would not quickly recognize.</p><p>Acronyms should be capitalized with no periods in front of the letters. There should be a period at the end of abbreviations, such as Dem. for Democrat.</p><p>Do not follow an organization’s full name with an abbreviation or acronym in parentheses or set off by dashes.
