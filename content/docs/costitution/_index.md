    1. Notification of the elections will be made by an announcement appearing on the website of _The Polytechnic_ two weeks immediately prior to the election.

    1. Election Procedures

        1. Only current members of the voting constituency on the day of elections are eligible to vote. The voting constituency shall consist of staff who are members of the Rensselaer Union, have contributed to _The Polytechnic_ for six weeks, have attended at least two consecutive business meetings, and have informed the editor in chief of their intention to join the voting staff. Membership in the voting constituency is maintained as long as an individual is a member of the Rensselaer Union, does not wish to resign, is not removed, and–should the member not hold a named position on _The Polytechnic_’s staff–informs the editor in chief of their desire to vote no less than one week before an election.

        1. Members of the voting constituency may nominate anyone, including themselves, for any elected position. Nominations for each position will be accepted until the time when the election for that position is begun. 

        1. Elections for each position shall be one at a time, in the order of: editor in chief, senior managing editor, managing editor(s), contributing editor(s), news editor, business manager, features editor, sports editor, editorial_opinion editor, composing editor, copy editor, photography editor, associate news editor(s), associate features editor(s), associate sports editor(s), associate editorial_opinion editor(s), associate composing editor(s), associate copy editor(s), and associate photography editor(s). An election for the position of editor in chief or senior managing editor shall not be held during the Spring election unless the position is vacant.

        1. When the turn comes for a certain position’s election to be held, all candidates shall be given equal time to speak on their own behalf, if they so choose. Then all candidates running for the position in question shall leave the room, and discussion shall be held amongst those present, with the editor in chief or highest ranking editor as defined below in section (VI), subsection (B), part (1) if the editor in chief is ineligible, presiding. Voting will then proceed as follows:	

            1. If the number of people nominated is greater than the total number of openings plus one, then a series of primary votes shall be held, with the person garnering the least number of votes eliminated after each balloting until only the total number of vacancies remain plus one.
            
            1. Once primaries, if necessary, are completed, each voting member will then vote for one person in the elections of editor in chief, senior managing editor, and all department editors; up to two people in the elections of managing editors, contributing editors, and all associate editors; or cast a no vote against all persons running. To win, a candidate must receive votes from a majority of a voting constituency quorum.

        1. All elections shall be held by secret ballot. This may be waived by the unanimous vote of the voting constituency quorum.

        1. Ballots for each election, both during primaries and final balloting, shall be counted by the editor in chief, or the next highest person in the order of succession as defined below in section (VI), subsection (B), part (1) if the editor in chief is ineligible due to a conflict of interest. Whoever is counting the ballots shall not vote in that election, but shall cast the deciding vote if a candidate receives exactly half of the votes of the voting constituency quorum.

        1. Quorum for elections is defined as two-thirds of the total voting constituency. 

        1. Absentee ballots shall be allowed. They must be submitted to the editor in chief in a sealed envelope no more than five days before the election. The person casting the ballots shall not count towards quorum during elections. 

        1. Abstentions may be used for any reason. A voter must recuse themselves in the event of a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Recusations do not count towards quorum and those recusing themselves may not participate in discussions.

        1. All winning candidates take office immediately upon completion of the election of their position, and the term of office of their predecessor, if there is one, ends at that time.

1. For all meetings, positions not filled shall not count towards quorum.
