# *The Polytechnic* Style Guide
Updated 11/14/2019 at 2:21 pm. That's "mm/dd/yyyy," by the way.

## How to use this guide
This guide is built to be as easily accessed as possible. Words in *italics* are used to show example usage, and e.g. means "for example."


## ​# 
#### 15th Street footbridge
Use *the 15th Street footbridge* on the first reference and *the footbridge* on subsequent references. Footbridge should be lowercase.

#### 24-hour
This construction is an adjective, so hyphenate it.

#### 3D, 2D, 1D
No hyphen.

#### ’86 Field
See [athletic facilities](#athletic-facilities).

#### ’87 Gym
See [athletic facilities](#athletic-facilities).

## A
#### a cappella
This word is well-established in the English language and does not need to be italicized. See [foreign language](#foreign-language) for more information.

#### abbreviations and acronyms
A few universally recognized abbreviations are required (and preferred) in some circumstances, such as TA or RA. Some others are acceptable depending on the context. But in general, do not use abbreviations or acronyms that the reader would not quickly recognize.
	
Acronyms should be capitalized with no periods in front of the letters. There should be a period at the end of abbreviations, such as Dem. for Democrat.
	
Do not follow an organization’s full name with an abbreviation or acronym in parentheses or set off by dashes. If an abbreviation or acronym would not be clear on second reference without this arrangement, do not use the abbreviation or acronym.
	
For time references, use am and pm without periods. For more help, see [time and date references](#time-and-date-references).

#### academic and administrative offices and departments
See [capitalization](#capitalization).

#### academic degrees
If mention of degrees is necessary to establish someone’s credentials, the preferred form is to avoid an abbreviation and use instead a phrase, e.g., *Harry Styles, who has a doctorate in chemical engineering...*

Use an apostrophe in bachelor’s and master’s degrees.

Use such abbreviations as B.S., M.S., Ph.D., etc. only when the need to identify many individuals by degree on first reference would make the preferred form unwieldy. Use these abbreviations only after a full name, never after just a last name.

Do not precede a name with a courtesy title for an academic degree and follow it with an abbreviation for the degree in the same reference; this is redundant. 

#### accents
See [diacritics](#diacritics).

#### addresses
For famous addresses like *1600 Pennsylvania Ave.*, use the abbreviations Ave., Blvd., and St. In all other cases, fully spell out the street name.

For compass points used to indicate a city’s quadrants in numbered addresses, abbreviate the direction without periods, e.g., *20126 Eighth Avenue NW*.

If there is no number, then do not abbreviate, e.g., *West 57th Street*.

Spell out and capitalize *First* through *Ninth* when used as street names; use figures with two letters for *10th* and above.

Lowercase and spell out street names when used with more than one street name, e.g., *15th and Hoosick streets*. See [plural](#plural) for more information.

Always use figures for an address number,e.g., *2 Union Square*, *1999 Burdett Avenue*.

#### administration
Avoid, especially in headlines. This non-specific reference to a body at RPI is just that, non-specific. Try to get names on who approved what new policy, etc. Prefer administrator.

#### administrator
Preferred over administration. 

#### Admissions Building
The full name of this building is the *Nancy Deloye Fitzroy ’49 and Roland V. Fitzroy Jr. Admissions Building*, use *Admissions Building* on all references.

#### advisor
Although “advisor” and “adviser” are both correct, use “advisor” for consistency, unless it’s a direct quote from written material.

#### alma mater
The school you graduated from, and, when capitalized, the song sung at formal ceremonies here at RPI.

#### majors

A list of undergraduate and graduate major codes can be found [here](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/srfs/degreeAppWithMajorCodes.pdf).

#### Markdown
A nice way to format and write plain text documents, like this style guide.

#### McNeil Room
The McNeil Room is the official name for the large room in the center of the second floor of the [Rensselaer Union](#rensselaer-union). Use *McNeil Room* on all references.

#### money
Use the dollar sign ($) rather than the word dollar, but use the word cents rather than the cent sign (¢). Always use figures for monetary references. Insignificant digits should be omitted.

>Wrong: one dollar, $1.00, $one  
>Right: $1  

>Wrong: $0.75  
>Right: $.75, 75 cents  

>Wrong: one hundred thousand dollars  
>Right: $100,000  

>Wrong: 2.25 million dollars  
>Right: $2.5 million  

For foreign currencies, change the currency symbol when necessary, or write out the currency if that’s unclear: *It cost me ¥5,000 for a ticket to the Tokyo Sky Tree.* *A loaf of bread was 20 lira.*

For foreign countries that use the dollar sign to denote their currency, use their currency abbreviation, or spell out the currency: *I bought a Canada Goose jacket for CA$600.* *My SCUBA lesson was 50 pesos.* 

For reference to a piece of currency, use the numerical value of the currency and its name, unless it has a specific name like *quarter*: *A $100 bill*, *A €1 coin*.

Be careful when referencing currency, especially foreign. For example, a Russian ruble is referenced with the ruble symbol after the number: *The taxi ride to the Kremlin cost 100₽.* 

Aim for clarity, and, when in doubt, Google for correct use (Wikipedia is helpful).

#### months
Capitalize, never abbreviate.

#### MLC

#### New York City
Use *New York City* on first reference, *NYC* subsequently. *New York, New York* or its derivatives should never be used. *New York* should only be used to reference the city when it’s clear that the State of New York is not the intended subject.

Place a comma around every group of 1,000.
>Wrong: 123456789

When using the word *Poly* or *Polytechnic* as an adjective, do not italicize or capitalize the leading the.

Editorial Board and Senior Board are to be capitalized. To pluralize *Poly*, italicize the name of the paper, but do not italicize the ‘S.’ Do not use “ies” or remove the ‘Y.’

#### possessives
A possessive ending in s should not have an ’s, just an apostrophe.

#### president of the Union

See also: [Executive Board](#executive-board).

#### president’s cabinet
This group is made up of the vice presidents, the provost, and selected deans.

#### Proctor’s Theatre
Note apostrophe and spelling. Use *Proctor’s Theatre* on first reference, *Proctor’s* subsequently.

#### pronouns
Use he or she when prefered by the referenced individual, "they" is an acceptable gender neutral pronoun and can be used to avoid awkward constructions like "he or she."

#### Public Safety
This is an acceptable abbreviation for the Department of Public Safety on all references. It is also an acceptable way to refer to the Public Safety Building on subsequent references, as long as there is no confusion between the department and the building. Use *Pub Safe* to refer to the department only in opinion pieces, if at all.

#### Public Safety Building
This building at the end of the [15th Street footbridge](#15th-street-footbridge) houses the Department of Public Safety.

#### Puckman
RPI's mascot, and SIS Man's biggest rival.

>Wrong: TA's in the ’80's  
>Right: TAs in the ’80s  

If two punctuation marks are called for in the same location, use only the stronger mark. Do not use an interrobang (‽) as an alternative.
>Wrong: What the hell?!  
>Right: What the hell?  
>Right: What the hell!  

Use commas in large numbers, e.g., *1,234,567,890*.

Use double quotes (“) and (”) to enclose words and phrases. Use single quotes (‘) and (’) to enclose single letters.

>Right: The sign read “Do Not Enter.”  

See [titles of works](#titles-of-works) for more rules on quotes.

#### quotations
Use partial quotations when possible, since too many full quotation marks makes the article appear to have been written by the interviewee, rather than the interviewer. Also, partial quotations allow for a smoother article.

Use quotations to get the source's reactions to the facts; hard facts can be paraphrased.

Commas and periods go inside closing quotation marks; semicolons and colons go outside closing quotation marks, e.g., *"I hope to have a long a productive life under Mao's rule," the peasant said.* See [punctuation](#punctuation) for more information.

If a question mark or exclamation point ends a quote, the symbol will go inside the closing quote, e.g., *"What should be done about the deteriorating building?" the villager asked. Chairman Mao proclaimed, "Aquire it for the people!"*

When identifying the source of a quotation, specify the person's source of expertise if it has not been previously explained in the article, e.g., *I think the drop in peasant labor is only temporary," an advisor to Chairman Mao, Hu Bao, said. "I fully expect it to recover following our Great Purge."*

When attributing quotations, use *said*. You can also use words like remarked, added, or explained. Do not use words like stated or ejaculated.

An indirect quotation is a paraphrase of the speakers ideas and opinions rather than a verbatim report. Quotation marks are not used for indirect quotations, e.g., *According to Mao, the building's collapse was due to the workers' ineptitude, not the cramped and hazardous living conditions.*

When a quotation is continued into another paragraph, do not end the first paragraph with a quotation mark, but place a quotation mark at the beginning of the second paragraph.

Quotation marks are sometimes used around [titles of works](#titles-of-works).

#### RCS ID
Short for *Rensselaer Computing System Userid* (note that "userid" is one word). Use *RCS ID* on all references.

#### recipe
See [fractions](#fractions) for how to refer an amount of ingredient. Use the common abbreviations for measurements, e.g. *cup*, *Tbsp.*, *tsp.*, *oz.* See the [Bon Appétit website](#https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes) for all things recipe formatting.

#### Rensselaer Union
Use on first reference, use *the Union* subsequently. Do not use *Student Union*.

Note that some varsity sports teams from other universities use the nickname “The Engineers,” like MIT. See colleges for proper nicknames.

Sports stories should analyze the why of the results; avoid play-by-play accounts of games. Try to get the reactions of players, coaches, and fans (including those of the opposing team) rather than simply giving a chronology of the game. Sports stories should present objective reporting, rather than the reporter’s opinions.

#### Thanksgiving Break

See [en dash](#en-dash) for correct formatting of date ranges. Never abbreviate the names on months. 

When referring to noon and midnight, do not say *12 noon* or *12 midnight*, this is redundant.

For date references, avoid such constructions as *last Tuesday* or *next Monday* when referring to days within a week before or after the date of publication. The use of the past or future tense should make such constructions redundant.

#### titles of persons

(Chinese people have their family name come before their given name.) For a listing of individuals and their current titles, refer to the [campus directory](https://info.rpi.edu/)

Titles should be capitalized when preceding a name, but not when following. Department names should still be capitalized if they are part of a title following a name, e.g. *First Chairman of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong and Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, discussed leadership over the masses*.

#### titles of works
A good rule of thumb for determining whether to italicize or put in quotations is the following: short works are put in quotes, long works are italicized.

Use italics when refering to the title of any publication, movie, journal, software program, video game, TV show, book, play, album, lecture series, or works of art.

Names of documents, like the *Rensselaer Union Guidelines & Procedures* are always italicized.

Use quotation marks to enclose the titles of songs, short stories, poems, TV episodes, *Poly* columns, theses, symphonies, board games, newspaper and magazine articles, or lecture titles.

From the Grammarly blog, "Proper names of ships and other vessels should be italicized just as titles are," e.g. the *Enola Gay*, *Challenger,* *Super Chief*, and *Orient Express*. Prefixes like H.M.S. and U.S.S are not italicized, e.g. the U.S.S. *Indianapolis*.

Clubs part of the Rensselaer Union (more properly known as “organizations”) are grouped into two main categories.

#### votes
When detailing the result of a vote, such as those from a Student Senate meeting, use [figure dashes](#figure-dashes), identical to sports scores. List votes for, votes against, and abstentions. The exception is when all members vote the same, when the word *unanimous* is preferred to figures. 
>Wrong: The Grand Marshal counted the vote incorrectly, reading 17 to three instead of 16 to four.
