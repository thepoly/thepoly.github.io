### What is second reading?

At _The Poly_, an article goes through three different readers. The first reader of an article is the one who checks for readability, grammar, and structure. It is the responsibility of the person that second reads to fact check everything in the article. If a person is referenced, a sports team or statistic mentioned, everything about the referenced fact must be correct. Mistakes and inaccuracies in articles undermine the public’s trust in our organization and should be prevented.

Put a check next to any information that you verify, no matter how small. This tells the third reader and editor in chief that you have double-checked that piece of information, so that they don’t spend time redoing your work.

### Great! How do I fact check? 

1. If you see a name, check the spelling with the [RPI student directory](https://info.rpi.edu/), Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, and/or any relevant agendas. If the person in question is a student, make sure to add a class year or a club title if necessary.
1. Check dates of events with a calendar and any event postings. 
1. Check quotes from documents with the original documents, and quotes from people with recordings supplied by the author.
1. Song titles and lyrics must be checked. Artist names must be checked. Release dates must also be checked. 
1. If you are editing a news article, make sure that all mentioned administrators' titles are correct. To do this, make sure that the title is written in its entirety on first reference. 
1. Use the RPI student directory and previous Poly articles to double-check titles. 
1. If you see a fact related to the school, like when EMPAC was created, you should look up the information via Google or use poly.rpi.edu. 
1. Another aspect of fact-checking is simply looking up assertions an author is making. Saying something like “RPI is the worst school in the world, rankings-wise” would not fly in a news or features article.
1. Assertions from people quoted in the article should also be checked. If their claims are ever inaccurate or heavily disputed, the quote should be juxtaposed with more information or clarification. 
1. When fact-checking, talk to the author of the article if they are available. Ask them about how they got certain pieces of information, then look up the information in the same manner they did. If you are able to get the information in the same way, then the fact can stay in the article. If not, then do more research to verify the fact. 
1. Make sure to check any statistics or data points.


### Major takeaways

The main thing to keep in mind when fact-checking is that if a writer is claiming something as a fact, it must be checked. If one of our authors analyzes something in the article and uses facts to back up their analysis, these facts must be checked or else the entire article may be inaccurate and could undermine (rightfully so) our credibility as a news organization.
